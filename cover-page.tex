\noindent \textsc{Instructions}
\begin{small}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fill in your email and section number at the top of this page. \textbf{Write your name on every sheet of paper.}
\item Your exam will be scanned into Gradescope, so if you normally write very lightly, make an effort to write a little darker than usual. % Uncomment if not using Gradescope
\item Read and follow the directions and requirements for each problem. \textbf{Show work whenever possible.} Full credit will be awarded for correct answers with supporting work \underline{and} correct notation.
\item \textbf{No scrap paper allowed.} Your work for each problem must be contained in the space for that problem.
\item \textbf{Simplify all answers.} Give exact answers (fractions) unless asked to round in the directions. Fractional answers should be reduced but not written as mixed numbers.
\item Do not ask questions during the test. We will not answer questions like ``Am I doing this right?'' or ``Can you tell me what this means?'' Follow the instructions given with the problem.\\
\end{itemize}
\end{small}

\noindent \textsc{Testing Environment Conditions}
\begin{small}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cell phones and other internet-capable devices must be \textbf{silenced} and \textbf{put away}. You may only access these devices after turning in your exam. No notes or resources (other than the provided formulas below) are allowed.
\item Other than those worn for medical or religious reasons, articles of clothing that obstruct the view of your face must be adjusted or removed. For example, baseball hats must be turned around or removed.
\item Wrist wear such as watches and fitness trackers that are not jewelry items must be removed and put away.
\item Only a TI-30X IIS calculator may be used and should be visible during use, not in your lap below the writing surface. No other type of calculator is allowed. You may not share calculators.
\item An instructor may ask you to move to a different seat during the exam. If so instructed, you are expected to comply swiftly and quietly. Being asked to move does not imply that a violation of the honor code has been committed.\\
